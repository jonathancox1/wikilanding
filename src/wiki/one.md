# First!

02/19/2022

So this is it, number one, the first, entry into what I'm titling a brain dump of ideas, thoughts and tid-bits I've learned along the way. I've recently read the wonderful book [Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/). So this is an act of **Record What You Learn**, a sort of diary of the process of a young **Software Craftsman**.

I make no promises, no consistency, and no exceptions. What's written in this space will be straight from my experiences to the page. I'll do my best to distill some sort of take-away but, I make no promises. At times it may seems as if my thoughts are all over the place, and that's most likely because they are, there's not going to be an overarching theme to this. And finally, I make no exceptions. My path and experience will not be sugar-coated or glossed over, as this is a space for truth and growth.

If you're still reading, then I invite you to continue with me, down this long and endless journey, where I seek to grow and develop as a **Software Craftsman**
