# Fail Fast and Delete It All

02/22/2022

> Everything's broken and nothing works

Everything's broken and nothing works, but why? You've taken the time to debug, maybe you've called upon a co-worker. After some time, you're still in the same spot, spinning, going nowhere.

> You're in the same spot, spinning, going nowhere.

I now know, after being in the situation I've outline above, that the answer is to stop, take a break, and **delete** it all. Now I say delete in the metaphorical sense, don't go deleting the entire solution or project. Get yourself back to square one, read over the req's and think. Don't do anything besides **think**.

You've now taken time to absorb the problem and you're ready to move forward. You find yourself approaching the solution with a new set of eyes, dodging the traps you unknowingly laid for yourself in the previous iteration. This sort of insight is invaluable, and in my opinion, cannot be taught. You only achieve this sort of 'awakening' through **failure**, so don't be afraid, we all fail.

> Make failing a habit, failing proves that you are pushing yourself and the concepts and ideas you have.

Call it quits, **delete** it all and just **think**.
