I've recently read the wonderful book [Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/). So this is an act of **Record What You Learn**, a sort of diary of the process of a young **Software Craftsman**.\r\n\r\nI make no promises, no consistency, and no exceptions. What's written in this space will be straight from my experiences to the page. I'll do my best to distill some sort of take-away but, I make no promises. At times it may seems as if my thoughts are all over the place, and that's most likely because they are, there's not going to be an overarching theme to this. And finally, I make no exceptions. My path and experience will not be sugar-coated or glossed over, as this is a space for truth and growth.\r\n\r\nIf you're still reading, then I invite you to continue with me, down this long and endless journey, where I seek to grow and develop as a **Software Craftsman**\r\n","url":"https://wiki.jonathan-cox.dev/one.html"},{"title":"Work Smarter - Ep. 1","content":"\r\n\r\n# Work Smarter - Ep. 1\r\n\r\n02/27/2022\r\n\r\n> The first episode in an on-going saga to work smarter.\r\n\r\nI have an endless passion for **efficiency**. I've got no clue where it comes from but I constantly want to be able to get to the same result quicker and with less intermediary steps.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I've built a keyboard that works exactly the way I want it to. Through time, I've mapped they keys to the exact position that makes sense for my brain. As a **Software Craftsman** I'm constantly typing syntax of semicolons, brackets and characters the average computer users never dreams of touching. So to make myself and my workflow more efficient, I've mapped those symbols to a much more continent location. Don't get me started on the backspace key...\r\n\r\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the thought I've put into the mapping of the keycodes to the actual keys. Beyond the **software**, I've thought of the **hardware** as well. Its not you're typical keyboard, its much much smaller. Whats known as a [40%](https://www.google.com/search?q=40%25%20keyboard&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS976US976&oq=40%25%20keyboard&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i433i512j0i512l8.2460j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) board, it has four rows of twelve keys, Everything I need is right there, within a very small fingers reach.\r\n\r\nNow Im not suggesting the reader shrink their keyboard and spend hours re-mapping and tweaking the layout. But urge the reader considers how they can increase their **efficiency**.\r\n","url":"https://wiki.jonathan-cox.dev/three.html"},{"title":"Fail Fast and Delete it All","content":"\r\n\r\n# Fail Fast and Delete It All\r\n\r\n02/22/2022\r\n\r\n> Everything's broken and nothing works\r\n\r\nEverything's broken and nothing works, but why? You've taken the time to debug, maybe you've called upon a co-worker. After some time, you're still in the same spot, spinning, going nowhere.\r\n\r\n> You're in the same spot, spinning, going nowhere.\r\n\r\nI now know, after being in the situation I've outline above, that the answer is to stop, take a break, and **delete** it all. Now I say delete in the metaphorical sense, don't go deleting the entire solution or project. Get yourself back to square one, read over the req's and think. Don't do anything besides **think**.\r\n\r\nYou've now taken time to absorb the problem and you're ready to move forward. You find yourself approaching the solution with a new set of eyes, dodging the traps you unknowingly laid for yourself in the previous iteration. This sort of insight is invaluable, and in my opinion, cannot be taught. You only achieve this sort of 'awakening' through **failure**, so don't be afraid, we all fail.\r\n\r\n> Make failing a habit, failing proves that you are pushing yourself and the concepts and ideas you have.\r\n\r\nCall it quits, **delete** it all and just **think**.\r\n","url":"https://wiki.jonathan-cox.dev/two.html"}];
